Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was a simulated client creating a driver's education system. They wanted to create a program accessible on any device with an internet connection. It was meant to be a system for booking reservations with instructors, taking practice exams, and other driver education services.

What did you do particularly well?

I dont feel that I did anything particullarly well as this course was very hard for me. However I did do my best and I feel I gained invaluable experience from this course. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would change my sequence diagram because I dont feel I commited enough time and research on it. I would make it simplier and easier to follow and understand in the future. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Interpretating user needs starts with the analysis of the system. You can use feedback from users and implement changes from that and from errors found from testers to make changes. User stories can help with gathering this information because this is where the users can express their needs and wants.  Looking at the user stories will help us understand the end users perspective. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?


To design software i would start by looking at the systems needs and start slowly. Once started I would work much more in detail following what the client has asked for.By following software architecture best practices and following what the needs are I would think through what the softwares needs are and have a clear understanding of what the requirments are.
